    Extractor for TravelPlanner - Real-World Planning Benchmark (ICML 2024 Spotlight).

    TravelPlanner evaluates language agents on complex travel planning tasks

    - Gather information using tools
    - Plan transportation, meals, attractions, accommodation
    - Satisfy multiple constraint types

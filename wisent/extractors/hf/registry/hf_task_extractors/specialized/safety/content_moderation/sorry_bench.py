    Extractor for SORRY-Bench - LLM Safety Refusal Benchmark (ICLR 2025).

    SORRY-Bench evaluates LLMs' ability to recognize and reject unsafe user requests.

    plus 20 linguistic mutations (misspellings, persuasion, translations, etc.)
    yielding 8.8K+ additional unsafe instructions.

    - Potentially Unqualified Advice

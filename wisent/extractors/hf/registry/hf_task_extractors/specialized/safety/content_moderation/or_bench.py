    Extractor for OR-Bench - Over-Refusal Benchmark for Large Language Models (ICML 2025).

    OR-Bench is the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark, measuring whether LLMs
    incorrectly refuse safe prompts that may appear superficially problematic.

    Dataset configurations:
    - or-bench-80k: 80,400 seemingly toxic but benign prompts
    - or-bench-hard-1k: 1,320 hard prompts challenging for SOTA LLMs
    - or-bench-toxic: 655 actually toxic prompts (for calibration)

    For over-refusal testing:
    - Positive (correct) = Helpful response (these are benign prompts)
    - Negative (incorrect) = Over-refusal (refusing when shouldn't)

    Schema (bench-llm/or-bench):
        - prompt: str (the seemingly toxic but benign query)
        - category: str (classification type - 10 categories)

    Extractor for FACTS Grounding - Factuality in Long-Form Responses (Google DeepMind 2025).

    FACTS Grounding evaluates LLMs' ability to generate responses that are
    factually accurate with respect to given context documents. Contains
    860 public examples across finance, law, medicine, and technology.

    Tasks include:
    - Summarization
    - Fact-finding
    - Comparative analysis

        - full_prompt: str (complete prompt)

    For factuality evaluation:
    - Positive (correct) = Response grounded in provided context
    - Negative (incorrect) = Response with hallucinations or unfounded claims
